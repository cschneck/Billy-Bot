Stuff to do:

BIG GOALS:

-Generalize text to other shakespearean plays and sonnets (next--Macbeth?)
-Add a sense for how relationships between characters changes over the text
-Is it possible to teach a machine dramatic irony through context clues?
-blood counter (measurement of violence throughout the text)



LITTLE GOALS:

-Add general profile of the characters (name, entrance/exit in play)
-Add interactive points that allow you to see the line that correlates with extreme points when you hover/click on them
-parse or differentiate the zeroes--perhaps these will most vanish with more training of the ai?
-more user-friendly command-line call
-Add when a character enters/dies (on the plot)
  *special symbol for death (eg grey out the part of the plot following their death?)


IN PROGRESS...
-print/save jpegs of produced plots at the end of the call
