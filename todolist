Stuff to do:

BIG GOALS:

-Generalize text to other shakespearean plays and sonnets
-Add a sense for how relationships between characters changes over the text
-Is it possible to teach a machine dramatic irony through context clues?




LITTLE GOALS:

-Add interactive points that allow you to see the line that correlates with extreme points when you hover/click on them
-parse or differentiate the zeroes--perhaps these will most vanish with more training of the ai?
-more user-friendly command-line call
-print/save jpegs of produced plots at the end of the call
