Stuff to do:

BIG GOALS:

-Generalize text to other shakespearean plays and sonnets




LITTLE GOALS:

-Add interactive points that allow you to see the line that correlates with extreme points when you hover/click on them
-parse or differentiate the zeroes?
-more user-friendly command-line call
-print/save jpegs of produced plots at the end of the call
